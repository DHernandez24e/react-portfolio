            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Thank you for visiting my page! My name is Diego Hernandez, and I am a budding web developer looking to 
                dive into expanding my horizons in this ever-growing field. I started learning about coding programs in
                high school but did not pursue it later on due to getting into different job fields. I started learning about
                full-stack web development through UC Berkeley Extension by the form of a 6 month bootcamp, where we picked up
                various skills, most notably learning the MERN stack. My ambition is to use said acquired skills and devote them
                to developing applications for tech companies and personal projects alike.
                <br />
                In my free time when I'm not coding or working my full-time, I like to relax and play music, spend time with my family
                and watch horror films for fun.
